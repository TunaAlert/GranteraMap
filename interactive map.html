                <p>
                    It's official name is <b>The Confederation of the Southern Plains of Grantera</b>. It's individual cities
                    have their own laws and customs and no nation-wide laws exist. The nation was founded due to <span class="reference" ref="auria-country">Auria</span>
                    threatening to take over the northern cities.

                        In the southern plains, magic is not as common as in other places, and the magic that does exist is oftentimes
                        rudamentary. This is not to say that the country is not advanced though, as they have taken a liking to
                        engineering in a more classical sense. Stories of magic going out of control are deeply engrained in the
                        folklore. The society is anarchical, so no one rules over anyone. This does not mean that it's a lawless places
                        though, as the people do follow rather strict, yet unwritten rules and violations of those will be punished.

                        <span class="reference" ref="auria-country">The Empire of Auria</span> was on a conquest to take over nearby regions and was largely successful, and
                        the southern plains seemed very attractive due to their rich land and weak military structure. However this
                        impression was misleading, as their will to keep their free lifestyle was strong and the individual regions
                        bonded together. At first, only the northernmost regions close to auria joined the confederation, however soon
                        the southern regions decided to join as well both in solidarity and to have the protective benefits in case of
                        a marine invasion. The central regions joined mostly for the benefits that trade routes provided.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Since the southern plains are relatively close to the equator they are pretty warm and since the land is very
                        flat apart from some hills the climate is very even across. There are a few forests but mostly you'll find,
                        like the name suggests, large plains of grass, flowers and bushes. Near the rivers there are many settlements
                        and a lot of agriculture to sustain the population, but further away from the rivers you'll only find the
                        occasional village.

                    <p>
                        The southern plains are largely inhabited by dark-skinned, hairless longears, although some people of other
                        races also migrated southwards. Most people hold a very conservative view on society, especially in regards to
                        magic and societal rules. People from other countries or even other regions of the southern plains are welcome
                        as long as they care to know the rules of the region they're in. People who disrespect those rules or suggests
                        a large change are usually exiled, imprisioned or in few cases executed.

                <p>
                    The countries official name is <b>The Great Empire of Auria</b>. It started off as a
                    <span class="reference" ref="auria-city">city in the mountains</span> that took over more and more of the
                    surrounding regions, grew its military might and became the largest country in the world.

                        Auria started off as a mining city in the mountains (<span class="reference" ref="auria-city">Auria City</span>)
                        which focused largely on mining gold, which is where it gets its name (lat. aurum = gold). This lead to the city
                        being known for its wealth and many people moved there. The cities government, which was an oligarchy at the time,
                        grew hungry for more power and started building an army intended to take over nearby regions, which promptly
                        happened.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At first the city ensured its control over nearby villages who accepted their fate
                        and joined the cities administration without any resistance. The first real fight was over the city of
                        <span class="reference" ref="besando-rios">Besando Rios</span>, which auria occupied from the far, south-eastern
                        side near the river, blocking off important trade routes in the process. After an occupation of 122 days the city
                        gave in and accepted to join Auria's administration on the condition that one elected representative may join Auria's
                        governing body. Auria accepted that deal, but the elected representative was always overshadowed by the other
                        oligarchs and not taken seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Auria used the resources of the regions it took over to strengthen and grow its army to ensure their conquest turns
                        out even more fruitful than it has up until that point. It split its Army into two fronts, one conquering along the
                        river towards <span class="reference" ref="porto-bosquo">Porto Bosquo</span>, the other along a mountain pass towards
                        <span class="reference" ref="cielo-verde">Cielo Verde</span>. Porto Bosquo was taken over in just 60 days as Auria
                        controlled most of their trade partners for metallic resources and trade routes. The region controlled by Cielo Verde
                        took 544 days to conquor as Auria was restricted by a mountain pass and Cielo Verde maintained their trade routes.
                        However, Auria managed to capture the city of Cielo Verde and with that the rest of the region under their administration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While conquering Cielo Verde, Auria also started taking over the regions down the river on the eastern front, which they
                        were very successful at, taking over everything until <span class="reference" ref="sangradelta">Sangradelta</span>,
                        where they tried to expand into what is now known as <span class="reference" ref="southern-plains">the Southern Plains</span>
                        which to their surprise was very unsuccessful as the individual regions bonded together and built an army of their own that
                        used boobytraps and ambushes to cut off small groups of Aurias army, which they could then overrun using a large amount of
                        people.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the capture of Cielo Verde's region, Auria was no longer landlocked and started building a marine fleet which they
                        used to occupy <span class="reference" ref="corrianta">Corrianta</span> both from the sea and the north-eastern land.
                        Corrianta, which belonged to a country called <span class="reference" ref="rios-montanos">Rios Montaños</span> which
                        expected this attack to occur, so Corrianta was not easy to capture. The war with Rios Montaños over Corrianta lasted
                        about 355 days, at which point Auria had managed to cut off supply routes well enough that they could enter the city.
                        It took almost 4 years to capture the rest of Rios Montaños, at which point Auria had also started a war with
                        <span class="reference" ref="pantera-blanca">Pantera Blanca</span> over
                        <span class="reference" ref="boca-mare">Boca Mare</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fight over <span class="reference" ref="boca-mare">Boca Mare</span> went by rather quickly, taking only 116 days, at
                        which point Auria expanded their front northward to <span class="reference" ref="deseaderra">Deseaderra</span>, whose
                        eastern side was captured in 203 days as supply routes by <span class="reference" ref="pantera-blanca">Pantera Blanca</span>
                        were weak. The western side was a lot better supplied and the fight over West-Deseaderra lasted until the end of the war
                        556 days later, before which Auria captured <span class="reference" ref="tierrablanca">Tierrablanca</span>.
