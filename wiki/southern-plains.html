    <h1>The Southern Plains</h1>
    <p>
        It's official name is <b>The Confederation of the Southern Plains of Grantera</b>. It's individual cities
        have their own laws and customs and no nation-wide laws exist. The nation was founded due to <span class="reference" ref="auria-country">Auria</span>
        threatening to take over the northern cities.
    </p>
    <h2>Lifestyle</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            In the southern plains, magic is not as common as in other places, and the magic that does exist is oftentimes
            rudamentary. This is not to say that the country is not advanced though, as they have taken a liking to
            engineering in a more classical sense. Stories of magic going out of control are deeply engrained in the
            folklore. The society is anarchical, so no one rules over anyone. This does not mean that it's a lawless places
            though, as the people do follow rather strict, yet unwritten rules and violations of those will be punished.
        </p>

    <h2>Foundation</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            <span class="reference" ref="auria-country">The Empire of Auria</span> was on a conquest to take over nearby regions and was largely successful, and
            the southern plains seemed very attractive due to their rich land and weak military structure. However this
            impression was misleading, as their will to keep their free lifestyle was strong and the individual regions
            bonded together. At first, only the northernmost regions close to auria joined the confederation, however soon
            the southern regions decided to join as well both in solidarity and to have the protective benefits in case of
            a marine invasion. The central regions joined mostly for the benefits that trade routes provided.
        </p>

    <h2>Climate and geography</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            Since the southern plains are relatively close to the equator they are pretty warm and since the land is very
            flat apart from some hills the climate is very even across. There are a few forests but mostly you'll find,
            like the name suggests, large plains of grass, flowers and bushes. Near the rivers there are many settlements
            and a lot of agriculture to sustain the population, but further away from the rivers you'll only find the
            occasional village.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>The people</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            The southern plains are largely inhabited by dark-skinned, hairless longears, although some people of other
            races also migrated southwards. Most people hold a very conservative view on society, especially in regards to
            magic and societal rules. People from other countries or even other regions of the southern plains are welcome
            as long as they care to know the rules of the region they're in. People who disrespect those rules or suggests
            a large change are usually exiled, imprisioned or in few cases executed.
