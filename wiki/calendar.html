    <h1>The calendar of Grantera</h1>
    <p>
        Grantera's calendar is based on its experience with magic, separated into 4 ages: Pre, Asin, Pureza and Sabi.
    </p>
    <h2>Pre</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
           The Pre age covers everything before the start of the Asin age and runs backwards, meaning year 1 Pre is the last
           year of this age, preceded by year 2 Pre. In this age, magic was not discovered yet.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Asin</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
           The Asin age, named after the discoverer of magic Asin, starts with magic's discovery in year 1 Asin. The Asin
           age lasted 523 years.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Pureza</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
           The Pureza age is coined by the Pureza belief which dictates a pure life free of magic. The Pureza belief started in
           the year 511 Asin and spread through all of Grantera in just 15 years. The Pureza age starts with the ban of magic in
           the <span class="reference" ref="northern-granteran-alliance">Northern-Granteran Alliance</span>. The Pureza age lasted
           217 years.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h2>Sabi</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
           The Sabi age (from sabidura = wisdom) is coined by the embrace of magic in the name of wisdom. In the year 212 Pureza,
           a large revolution in today's <span class="reference" ref="ontigoron">Ontigoron</span> fought against the Pureza belief
           and slowly pushed it out of existance. With the start of the Sabi age, the revolution disbanded the
           <span class="reference" ref="northern-granteran-alliance">Northern-Granteran Alliance</span> and with it the ban on
           magic. North and central Grantera grew to embrace magic and its potential while the south held onto the Pureza belief
           much longer and only accepted rudamentary magic into their lifestyle.
        </p>
        <p>
            The present year is around 312 Sabi.
