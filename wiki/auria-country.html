    <h1>The empire Auria</h1>
    <p>
        The countries official name is <b>The Great Empire of Auria</b>. It started off as a
        <span class="reference" ref="auria-city">city in the mountains</span> that took over more and more of the
        surrounding regions, grew its military might and became the largest country in the world.

    <div>
        <p>
            Auria started off as a mining city in the mountains (<span class="reference" ref="auria-city">Auria City</span>)
            which focused largely on mining gold, which is where it gets its name (lat. aurum = gold). This lead to the city
            being known for its wealth and many people moved there. The cities government, which was an oligarchy at the time,
            grew hungry for more power and started building an army intended to take over nearby regions, which promptly
            happened.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first the city ensured its control over nearby villages who accepted their fate
            and joined the cities administration without any resistance. The first real fight was over the city of
            <span class="reference" ref="besando-rios">Besando Rios</span>, which auria occupied from the far, south-eastern
            side near the river, blocking off important trade routes in the process. After an occupation of 122 days the city
            gave in and accepted to join Auria's administration on the condition that one elected representative may join Auria's
            governing body. Auria accepted that deal, but the elected representative was always overshadowed by the other
            oligarchs and not taken seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
            Auria used the resources of the regions it took over to strengthen and grow its army to ensure their conquest turns
            out even more fruitful than it has up until that point. It split its Army into two fronts, one conquering along the
            river towards <span class="reference" ref="porto-bosquo">Porto Bosquo</span>, the other along a mountain pass towards
            <span class="reference" ref="cielo-verde">Cielo Verde</span>. Porto Bosquo was taken over in just 60 days as Auria
            controlled most of their trade partners for metallic resources and trade routes. The region controlled by Cielo Verde
            took 544 days to conquor as Auria was restricted by a mountain pass and Cielo Verde maintained their trade routes.
            However, Auria managed to capture the city of Cielo Verde and with that the rest of the region under their administration.
        </p>
        <p>
            While conquering Cielo Verde, Auria also started taking over the regions down the river on the eastern front, which they
            were very successful at, taking over everything until <span class="reference" ref="sangradelta">Sangradelta</span>,
            where they tried to expand into what is now known as <span class="reference" ref="southern-plains">the Southern Plains</span>
            which to their surprise was very unsuccessful as the individual regions bonded together and built an army of their own that
            used boobytraps and ambushes to cut off small groups of Aurias army, which they could then overrun using a large amount of
            people.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the capture of Cielo Verde's region, Auria was no longer landlocked and started building a marine fleet which they
            used to occupy <span class="reference" ref="corrianta">Corrianta</span> both from the sea and the north-eastern land.
            Corrianta, which belonged to a country called <span class="reference" ref="rios-montanos">Rios Montaños</span> which
            expected this attack to occur, so Corrianta was not easy to capture. The war with Rios Montaños over Corrianta lasted
            about 355 days, at which point Auria had managed to cut off supply routes well enough that they could enter the city.
            It took almost 4 years to capture the rest of Rios Montaños, at which point Auria had also started a war with
            <span class="reference" ref="pantera-blanca">Pantera Blanca</span> over
            <span class="reference" ref="boca-mare">Boca Mare</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The fight over <span class="reference" ref="boca-mare">Boca Mare</span> went by rather quickly, taking only 116 days, at
            which point Auria expanded their front northward to <span class="reference" ref="deseaderra">Deseaderra</span>, whose
            eastern side was captured in 203 days as supply routes by <span class="reference" ref="pantera-blanca">Pantera Blanca</span>
            were weak. The western side was a lot better supplied and the fight over West-Deseaderra lasted until the end of the war
            556 days later, before which Auria captured <span class="reference" ref="tierrablanca">Tierrablanca</span>.
